**Argument**: people have been using mouses to play ultrabullet, or tablets, or phones, and since KB is so different and much faster, it gives an unfair advantage and therefore isn't fair. \n
**Refutation**: ultrabullet or bullet weren't created or meant to be a mouse skill game. It is only by accident, due to limitations of our input methods. It just so happened that mouses are the most common input device. Playing with a mouse is not a rule, nor is it a part of the game, it is most common simply due to the fact that there were no alternatives. If a sport is created with a rule, the rule becomes a part of the game, i.e. you cannot use hands in soccer, even though it would be more efficient. Fast chess weren't "created" with such rules, they only inherited the rules of chess, input methods are totally optional. 

**Argument**: king walks (circling your king in a time scramble) are unfair because it's not the user who generates the moves, but the KB extension.
**Refutation**: it's still the user who generates the moves. Imagine a device that could read your thoughts and transfer them directly into the computer. Now imagine thinking about the king moving up. Then imagine the king moving up and down quickly. Then imagine the king going in circles, imagine quickly thinking about the king going to all nearby squares. You don't have to name the moves, direction, or say the words "king", "square". Just your slightest thought of the king going somewhere will actually move the king there, if the move is legal. Using KB is similar, the difference is that you first have to transfer your thoughts to your hand muscles. So moving your hand whatever way is the same thing you could achieve with your thoughts. The fact that it might be reflex and that the moves are not always deliberate doesn't invalidate the legitimacy of such moves, because your thoughts can be also reflex, and there is nothing invalid about producing an action in a game reflexively. When playing with a mouse, certain quick moves are also produced reflexively. 

**Argument**: multipremoves are unfair because Lichess is a one premove website.
**Refutation**: Lichess is a one premove website not by reason of a rule that restricts the amount of premoves, but because implementing multiple premoves would be too complex to do and maintain. What are some uses of multiple premoves:
- Premoving a checkmate when the opponent leaves in hope to return later and claim the victory — quite useful.
- Time scrambles — useful, unless the player already uses KB. KB is already very fast and multiple premoves don't add much speed, on the contrary — might introduce errors. 
- Fun — multipremoving a checkmate or a beautiful sacrifice during a stream can be very impressive.
All these usecases are interesting, but not ubiquitous enough to warrant spending a lot of time adding and maintaining this interesting feature. But since it's not a rule to have only one premove, there is no restriction on changing the interface yourself to enable this feature.

**Argument**: KB is unfair because it's significantly faster than other input methods.
**Refutation**: the first point applies. Speed of the input method isn't in the rules of ultrabullet. It wasn't intended to be a mouse skill game. The speed with which one can input moves, produced by the brain or reflexes, is irrelevant, since any existing limits are there not due to restrictions imposed by a rule, but due to limitations of our technology. 

**Argument**: using more than one key at a time is unfair.
**Refutation**: the point two applies. Our brain is capable of quickly imagining two or more pieces going to a certain square, or multiple squares almost simultaneously. If our brain can create such a signal, that can be clearly interpreted by a machine and doesn't include any additional knowledge generated by the machine, then our muscle reflexes (largely controlled by the brain) producing similar input falls into the legal area.   


**Argument**: what if we create a slider with all legal moves, and just move this slider back and forth to produce random moves? This would be the same as KB and would be a random move generator in essense and therefore unfair.
**Refutation**: this wouldn't be the same as KB. First, KB doesn't show you the legal moves. Only legal moves are played, because Lichess interface would always reject illegal moves. (There is an assumption in KB code however that the user would always play legal premoves [pseudo-legal moves]. Such an assumtion might be controversial, but there are similar incidents: Lichess shows legal moves when a piece is clicked. Can this be considered computer assistance? It is, but we assume it doesn't significantly impact the game. This should still remain a subject for discussion.) So we arrive at a slider with all generally possible moves [pseudo-legal moves], which the user can move however they want and it would produce a move. Such a slider is not equivalent to the KB extension. It would be a different game, and there is no proof that the user moving the slider can translate the moves, written on it, into an image of a board with pieces. When the user is playing with KB, they can do similar things they would be able to do with a brain-computer interface (BCI). And not only those things would be similar in speed, but also in nature. With a slider, it would be impossible for a human brain to immediately translate all the moves written on a slider into an actual board with pieces. The problem with this concept is that there are no strict borders to where human abilty begins and ends. We can only speculate approximately. But in the case of a slider, the amount of operations the brain would have to perform to actually translate it into an image of the board with pieces is so great that it's definitely not an appropriate KB counter example.
