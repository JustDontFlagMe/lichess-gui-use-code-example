___________________________
w     = Moves a pawn forward. <br />
q     = Take with a pawn to the left <br />
e     = Take with a pawn to the right <br />
s     = Queen <br />
shift = King <br />
a     = The left knight (without a green square) <br />
d     = The right knight (with a green square) <br />
1     = The left rook (without a green square) <br />
3     = The right rook (with a green square) <br />
space = Bishops <br />
(You can change keys to any other keys) <br />

8. Try this in a game. To move a piece you have to hover your mouse cursor over a square-destination and press a corresponding key (you don't have to click your mouse buttons). For example, hover your mouse cursor over e4 and press "w". 

9. To change the keys, open the script (Tampermonkey icon, Dashboard, KeyboardLichessKeys), and find this part in the beginning:
