**Argument**: people have been using mouses to play ultrabullet, or tablets, or phones, and since KB is so different and much faster, it gives an unfair advantage and therefore isn't fair.
**Refutation**: ultrabullet or bullet weren't created or meant to be a mouse skill game. It is only by accident, due to limitations of our input methods. It just so happened that mouses are the most common input device. Playing with a mouse is not a rule, nor is it a part of the game, it is most common simply due to the fact that there were no alternatives. If a sport is created with a rule, the rule becomes a part of the game, i.e. you cannot use hands in soccer, even though it would be more efficient. Fast chess weren't "created" with such rules, they only inherited the rules of chess, input methods are totally optional. 

**Argument**: king walks (circling your king in a time scramble) are unfair because it's not the user who generates the moves, but the KB extension.
**Refutation**: it's still the user who generates the moves. Imagine a device that could read your thoughts and transfer them directly into the computer. Now imagine thinking about the king moving up. Then imagine the king moving up and down quickly. Then imagine the king going in circles, imagine quickly thinking about the king going to all nearby squares. You don't have to name the moves, direction, or say the words "king", "square". Just your slightest thought of the king going somewhere will actually move the king there, if the move is legal. Using KB is similar, the difference is that you first have to transfer your thoughts to your hand muscles. So moving your hand whatever way is the same thing you could achieve with your thoughts. The fact that it might be reflex and that the moves are not always deliberate doesn't invalidate the legitimacy of such moves, because your thoughts can be also reflex, and there is nothing invalid about producing an action in a game reflexively. When playing with a mouse, certain quick moves are also produced reflexively.
